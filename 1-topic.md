# QUEUE
We all had to experience the sadness of waiting in queue for anything, while sitting there have you wonder if there was a different process, or how queues work in other places? 

Like our cousing Stack, queue is a linear data structure that store items in First In First out. We will use the acronym FIFO because why not. The best way to explain it would be a deli meat where you would get a number and wait for your number to be called. If you get there first, then they will call your name first, hence, first in first out. FIFO.
