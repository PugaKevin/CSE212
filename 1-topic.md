# QUEUE
We all had to experience the sadness of waiting in queue for anything, while sitting there have you wonder if there was a different process, or how queues work in other places? 

Like our cousing Stack, queue is a linear data structure that store items in First In First out. We will use the acronym FIFO because why not. The best way to explain it would be a deli meat where you would get a number and wait for your number to be called. If you get there first, then they will call your name first, hence, first in first out. FIFO. 

## Terms to know
* Enqueue: "En" in latin means in or into. Using the Enqueue will add items to the queue. 
* Dequeue: Removes item from the queue. Think of the word decrease and what beginning part of it which is DE. If you decrease something you make it smaller. That what dequeue does. It remeoves from the queue.
