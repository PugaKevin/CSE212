# Python Data Structures Tutorial
Welcome to the Python Data Structures, where I make you question life itself. Successful programers must know how to efficiently code and these topic are going to help you: 

* [Queue](1-topic.md) 
* [Set](2-topic.md)
* [Tree](3-topic.md)

Each bullet point will give you a description and examples needed to understand the concept. At the end of each module there will be a problem for you to solve on your own. Look at the solution only after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
