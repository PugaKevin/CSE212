# SET
We previously learn about about queues. Where order was important, well what if you want it to be in an order of chaos. *The natural order is disorder* - Zaheer. This is where Sets come in. Set is a data structure where order is not important. 

Another difference of a set is that it does not allow duplicates. There can only be one...

We can store more information because we don't care about order which can make it more efficient.
